0,Security in Microservices Architectures,2021, a microservice is a small or even micro independent process that communicates acts and returns via messages through lightweight mechanisms like thrift http or restapi microservices architecture is amateur evolution of the monolithic architecture observing it in a functional way it is correct to claim that it breaks down complex applications into a simpler abstraction as this research demonstrates microservices architecture is intrinsically connected as a symbiosis with container based deployment because these containers have no need for embedded operating systems and calls are made for os resources via an application programming interface it is safe to claim that this technology is currently the focus of modern developers nowadays semantically speaking microservices functionally deconstruct larger applications into smaller discrete services and containers are viewed as a natural compute platform for this architecture a single service is and can be represented by multiple containers in a microservices cluster each single service is designed to provide a specific set of functions while services act to makeup the entire application it common in large application the decomposition into multiple arms of more than twenty services although less can be commonly found as well the main objective of microservices architecture is to disassemble the core components of a given type of application this study could be done in multiple ways all of them different because practically everybody has their specific way of looking at microservices but one aspect is the same cross mentalities security so the focus of this research is to expose the main security aspects of this specific architecture in this cost effective era 
1,Detecting Cyber Security Attacks against a Microservices Application using Distributed Tracing,2021, microservices are emerging as the dominant software design architecture for many different applications and cyber attacks are targeting more software organisations every day newer techniques for detecting cyber intrusions against such applications are in high demand application functionality that is executed within a microservices application can be monitored and logged using distributed tracing distributed tracing is normally used for performance management of microservices applications in this paper we used distributed tracing for detecting cyber security attacks each microservice call or sequence of calls executed in response to a request by an end user of the application is logged as a trace anomaly detection is a means of detecting irregular or unusual events or patterns in a data set that occur to a greater or a lesser degree than the majority of the data in this paper we present initial work that identifies anomalous distributions of traces a frequency distribution of traces is obtained from normal data and traffic is identified as an anomaly candidate if it differs sufficiently from the base distribution this approach is evaluated using a password guessing attack in addition we briefly discuss a nosql injection attack which we argue is difficult to detect using trace data 
2,Robust Failure Diagnosis of Microservice System through Multimodal Data,2023, automatic failure diagnosis is crucial for large microservice systems currently most failure diagnosis methods rely solely on single modal data in this study we conduct an empirical study using real world failure cases to show that combining these sources of data leads to a more accurate diagnosis however effectively representing this data and addressing imbalanced failures remain a challenge to tackle these issues we introduce diagfusion a robust failure diagnosis approach that uses multimodal data it leverages embedding techniques and data augmentation to represent the multimodal data of service instances combines deployment data and traces to build a dependency graph and uses a graph neural network to localize the root cause instance and determine the failure type our evaluations using real world datasets show that diagfusion outperforms existing methods in terms of root cause instance localization and failure type determination 
3,eZTrust: Network-Independent Zero-Trust Perimeterization for Microservices,2019, emerging microservices based workloads introduce new security risks in today data centers as attacks can propagate laterally within the data center relatively easily by exploiting cross service dependencies as countermeasures for such attacks traditional perimeterization approaches such as network endpoint based access control do not fare well in highly dynamic microservices environments in this paper we propose eztrust anetwork independent perimeterization approach for microservices eztrust allows data center tenants to express access control policies based on fine grained workload identities and enables data center operators to enforce such policies reliably and efficiently in a purely network independent fashion to this end we leverage ebpf the extended berkeley packet filter to trace authentic workload identities and apply per packet tagging and verification we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through extensive evaluation of our proof of concept prototype implementation we find that when comparable policies are enforced eztrust incurs times lower packet latency and times lower cpu overhead than traditional perimeterization schemes 
4,Identifying Availability Tactics to Support Security Architectural Design of Microservice-based Systems,2019, microservices is an architectural style that considers systems as modular customer centric independent and scalable suite of services in order to address security requirements in microservices based systems architects often must focus on critical quality attributes such as availability aiming at employing architectural solutions that provide design decisions that address key security concerns although current architectural tactics for availability offer an extensive catalog of alternatives to improve availability and security factors new availability concerns demand new or improved architectural tactics in this article we examined the source code and documentation of open source microservices based systems identified uses of availability tactics and characterized them using anewly introduced descriptive template we found that almost all tactics did focus on preventing faults rather than detecting mitigating or recovering from them this approach can be further used to systematically identify and characterize architectural tactics in existing microservices based systems in other critical quality attributes concerning security such as confidentiality and integrity 
5,A Game of Microservices: Automated Intrusion Response,2023, the microservice architecture is a subtype of distributed systems that has been attracting a lot of interest both in the industry and academia emerging research recognizes the need for a better understanding of microservice security and in particular mechanisms that enable defense in depth and adaptive security with the continuously growing number of possible attacks and defenses the choice in the optimal defense strategy becomes non trivial as well as time critical we propose a cost sensitive adaptable intrusion response system for microservices which uses a game theoretic approach to automatically respond to network attacks in real time furthermore we discuss both the applicable attacks and defense responses specific to microservices 
6,Security Considerations for Microservice Architectures,2019, security is an important and difficult topic in today complex computer systems cloud based systems adopting microservice architectures complicate that analysis by introducing additional layers in the test system analyzed base layers are combined into three groups and possible security risks introduced by technologies used in these layers are analyzed the application layer focuses on security concerns that concern authorization and authentication the analysis is based on a microservice based rewritten version of the seat reservation system of the deutsche bahn using technologies such as amazon web services docker and kubernetes the comparison concludes that the security of communication in the test system could be significantly improved with little effort if security is not considered as an integral part from the beginning of a project it can easily be neglected and be expensive to add later on

8,A Subgrid-Oriented Privacy-Preserving Microservice Framework Based on Deep Neural Network for False Data Injection Attack Detection in Smart Grids,2021, false data injection attacks have recently become a major threat to smart grids most of the existing fdia detection methods have focused on modeling the temporal relationship of time series measurement data but have paid less attention to the spatial relationship between bus line measurement data and have failed to consider the relationship between subgrids to address these issues in this article we propose a subgrid oriented microservice framework by integrating a well designed spatialtemporal neural network for fdia detection in ac model power systems first a well designed neural network is developed to model the spatial temporal relationship of bus line measurements for subgrids a microservice based supervising network is then proposed for integrating the representation features obtained from subgrids for the collaborative detection of fdias to evaluate the proposed framework three types of fdia datasets are generated based on a public benchmark power gridcase studies on the fdia datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art methods for fdia detection in these datasets 
9,Attribute-Based Access Control in Service Mesh,2019, cloud applications can consist of hundreds of services with thousands of instances in order to solve the problems of interservice interaction in this highly dynamic environment an additional software infrastructure layer called service mesh is introduced this layer provides a single point of interaction with the network for each service service mesh mechanisms are responsible for load balancing processing of network requests service discovery authentication authorization etc however the following questions arise complex key management fine grained access control at the application level confidentiality of data and many to many communications it is possible to solve these problems with attribute based encryption methods this paper presents an abstract model of a service mesh and a protocol for interservice communications which uses abe for authorization and confidentiality of the messages 
10,Automated Security Analysis for Microservice Architecture,2020, designing a software system that applied the microservice architecture style is a challenging task as its characteristics are vulnerable to various security attacks software architect therefore needs to pinpoint the security flaws in the design before the implementation can proceed this task is error prone as it requires manual analysis on the design model to identify security threats and trace possible attack scenariosthis paper presents an automated security analysis approach for microservice architecture our approach can automatically identify security threats according to a collection of formally defined security characteristics and provide an insightful result that demonstrates how the attack scenarios may happen a collection of formally defined security characteristics can be extended to support other security characteristics not addressed in this paper

13,Component-Based Refinement and Verification of Information-Flow Security Policies for Cyber-Physical Microservice Architectures,2019, since cyber physical systems are inherently vulnerable to information leaks software architects need to reason about security policies to define desired and undesired information flow through a system the microservice architectural style requires the architects to refine a macro level security policy into micro level policies for individual microservices however when policies are refined in an ill formed way information leaks can emerge on composition of microservices related approaches to prevent such leaks do not take into account characteristics of cyber physical systems like real time behavior or message passing communication in this paper we enable the refinement and verification of information flow security policies for cyber physical microservice architectures we provide architects with a set of well formedness rules for refining a macro level policy in a way that enforces its security restrictions based on the resulting micro level policies we present a verification technique to check if the real time message passing of microservices is secure in combination our contributions prevent information leaks from emerging on composition we evaluate the accuracy of our approach using an extension of the cocome case study 
14,ConfigRand: A Moving Target Defense Framework against the Shared Kernel Information Leakages for Container-based Cloud,2021, lightweight virtualization represented by container technology provides a virtual environment for cloud services with more flexibility and efficiency due to the kernel sharing property however the shared kernel also means that the system isolation mechanisms are incomplete attackers can scan the shared system configuration files to explore vulnerabilities for launching attacks previous works mainly eliminate the problem by fixing operating systems or using access control policiesbut these methods require significant modifications and cannot meet the security needs of individual containers accurately in this paper we present configrand a moving target defense framework to prevent the information leakages due to the shared kernel in the container based cloud the configrand deploys deceptive system configurations for each container bounding the scan of attackers aimed at the shared kernel in design ofconfigrand we propose a framework applying the moving target defense philosophy to periodically generate distribute and deploy the deceptive system configurations in the container based cloud establish a model to formalize these configurations and quantify their heterogeneity present a configuration movement strategy to evaluate and optimize the variation of configurations the results show that configrand can effectively prevent the information leakages due to the shared kernel and apply to typical container applications with minimal system modification and performance degradation

17,Evaluation of security threats in microservice architectures,2022, i abstract the microservice architecture is a popular architectural pattern in the industry to implement large systems as they can reduce the code bases of each service and increase the maintainability for each of the individual services by dividing the application into smaller components based on business logic the services can be implemented in different programming languages and communicates over anetwork as a consequence it might lead to a greater attack surface for an adversary of the system in order to ease the implementation of microservice architectures a set of design patterns exists two patterns addressing the security of the architecture are the api gateway pattern and the sidecar pattern more research is needed in order to identify the security threats microservice architecture encounters and how the design pattern handles those this master thesis uses threat modeling withattack graphs along withattack simulations in order to investigate the threats in microservice architectures and how they compare between the design patterns to construct the attack graphs and perform the attack simulations securicad along with corelang was used on a microservice architecture with each of the design patterns the report concludes that the sidecar pattern is faced with less risk than the api gateway pattern overall and presents a set of suggestions regarding how the security can be improved in microservice architectures

39,SFTSDH: Applying Spring Security Framework With TSD-Based OAuth2 to Protect Microservice Architecture APIs,2022, the iomt combines medical devices and applications that use network technologies to connecthealthcare information systems iomt is reforming the medical industry by adopting information and communication technologies identity verification secure collection and exchange of medical data are essential in health applications in this study we implemented a hybrid security solution to secure the collection and management of personal health data using spring framework services for sensitive data as a service platform and http security methods the adopted solution instigated the following security features identity brokering oauth multifactor authentication and access control to protect the microservices architecture application programming interfaces following the general data protection regulation moreover we extended the adopted security solution to develop a digital infrastructure to facilitate the research and innovation work in the electronic health section focusing on solution validation with theoretical evaluation and experimental testing we used a web engineering security methodology to achieve and explain the adopted security solution as a case study we designed and implemented electronic coaching prototype system and deployed the same in the developed infrastructure to securely record and share personal health data furthermore we compared the test results with related studies qualitatively for the efficient evaluation of the implemented security solution the sftsdh implementation and configuration in the prototype system have effectively secured the ecoach apis from an attack in all the considered scenarios the ecoach prototype with the sftsdh solution effectively sustained a load of concurrent users in the developed digital health infrastructure in addition we performed a qualitative comparison among the following security solutions sf security third party security and sftsdh where sftsdh showed a promising outcome 
40,Stay at the Helm: secure Kubernetes deployments via graph generation and attack reconstruction,2022, in recent years there has been an explosion of attacks directed at microservice based platforms a trend that follows closely the massive shift of the digital industries towards these environments management and operation of container based microservices is automation heavy leveraging on container orchestration engines such as kubernetes helm is the package manager of choice for ks and provides charts ie configuration files that define a programmatic model for application deployments in this paper we propose anovel methodology for extracting and evaluating the security model of helm charts our proposal extracts a topological graph of the chart whose nodes and edges are then characterised by security features we carry out risk assessments that refer to the attack tactics of the mitre attck framework furthermore starting from these scores we extract the riskiest attack paths we adopt an experimental validation approach by analysing a dataset created from multiple publicly accessible helm chart repositories our methodology reveals that in most cases they have vulnerabilities that can be exploited through complex attack paths 
41,Towards Secure and Leak-Free Workflows Using Microservice Isolation,2021, companies like netflix increasingly use the cloud to deploy their business processes those processes often involve partnerships with other companies and can be modeled as workflows this shift towards the cloud environment has led to more and more data leaks and breaches resulting in huge losses of money for businesses like the movie industry as well as a loss of user privacy for businesses dealing with user data like the pharmaceutical industry in this paper we show how those workflows can be enforced while preventing data exposure following the principles of zero trust we develop an infrastructure using the isolation provided by a microservice architecture to enforce owner policy we show that our infrastructure is resilient to the set of attacks considered in our security model we implement a simple yet realistic workflow with our infrastructure in a publicly available proof of concept we then verify that the specified policy is correctly enforced by testing the deployment for policy violations and estimate the overhead cost of authorization
